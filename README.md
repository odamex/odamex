Odamex is a modification of DOOM to allow players to compete with each other over the Internet using a client/server architecture. Thanks to the source code release of DOOM by id Software in December 1997, there have been many modifications that enhanced DOOM in various ways. These modifications are known as "source ports", as early modifications mainly ported DOOM to other platforms and operating systems such as Windows and Macintosh.

Odamex is based on the CSDoom 0.62 source code originally created by Sergey Makovkin, which is based on the ZDoom 1.22 source code created by Marisa Heit.

Compilation instructions
------------------------

Clone the repositories, with all submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/odamex/odamex.git --recurse-submodules

If you downloaded the zip, use these commands on the git directory:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Odamex requires the following tools and libraries:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.13 or later
* [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [SDL2-Mixer](https://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
* [cURL](https://curl.se/)
* [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
* [zlib](https://zlib.net/)
* [DeuTex](https://github.com/Doom-Utils/deutex/releases/) (for building the WAD)
* [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/) (for the launcher)

`cURL`, `libPNG` and `zlib` are automatically included in-tree as submodules.

On Windows, all libraries are automatically downloaded if not found.  On \*nix/MacOSX, you will need to download through your package manager `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-mixer-dev` and `libwxgtk3.0-dev`.

**Note**: This project contains a demo testing utility that ensures vanilla compatibility by
running a specific set of demos after each commit. When forking this project to prepare a pull request,
this functionality will be unavailable by default to protect sensitive files.
You can restore this functionality by:

1. Forking [OdaTest-Resources](https://github.com/odamex/odatests-resources) to get the PWADs.
2. Downloading [OdaTests](https://github.com/odamex/odatests) to get the encryption module.
3. Replacing the encrypted IWADs with your own set of encrypted IWADs.
Encrypt using `python .\secret.py encrypt doom2` with the environment variable
`SECRET_KEY` defined to encrypt the IWADs with. The following IWADs (latest version) are needed to run all tests:
`doom, doom1, doom2, tnt, plutonia, hacx`
4. Create a release for your forked OdaTest-Resources repo.
5. Enter the following Secrets / Repository Variables in GitHub:
  - `secrets.DEMOTESTER_IWAD_KEY` - Encryption key for the IWADs
  - `vars.DEMOTESTER_DOWNLOAD_URL` - Full URL to download the latest OdaTests release.
  - `vars.DEMORESOURCES_DOWNLOAD_URL` - Full URL to download your personal demo resources
