// DESCRIPTION:
//
//  denis - szp<T>, the self zeroing pointer
//  
//  Once upon a time, actors held raw pointers to other actors. 
//  
//  To destroy an object, one cycled though all the others searching for its 
//  pointer and resetting every copy to NULL. Then one did the cycling for 
//  the players, then the sector sound origins, and so on; with hack upon 
//  hack. Ironically, zero dereferencing is what often crashed the 
//  program altogether.
//  
//  The idea behind szp is that all copies of one szp pointer can be made 
//  to point to the same object in O(1) time. This means that having a 
//  single szp of an actor, you can set them all to NULL without iteration. 
//  And, as a bonus, on every pointer access, a NULL check can throw a 
//  specific exception. Naturally, you should always be careful with pointers.
//
