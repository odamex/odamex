===============================================================================

Odamex is a modification of DOOM to allow players to compete with each other
over the Internet using a client/server architecture. Thanks to the source code
release of DOOM by id Software in December 1997, there have been many
modifications that enhanced DOOM in various ways. These modifications are known
as "source ports", as early modifications mainly ported DOOM to other platforms
and operating systems such as Windows and Macintosh.

Odamex is based on the CSDoom 0.62 source code originally created by Sergey
Makovkin, which is based on the ZDoom 1.22 source code created by Marisa Heit.
