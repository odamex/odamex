Odamex incorporates code and libraries from a number of different projects.
This document contains licenses for libraries that have no separate license
file, portions of code that have been copied into the project wholesale, or
have some other special circumstance.

The licenses are listed with ZDoom coming first, then in alphabetical order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
License of ZDoom 1.22
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The author of ZDoom, Marisa Heit, has graciously allowed Odamex to use code
from ZDoom 1.22 that was hers to give under the terms of the GNU General
Public License v2 or later.  Thank you.

License of JsonCpp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JsonCpp library's source code, including accompanying documentation, 
tests and demonstration applications, are licensed under the following
conditions...

The author (Baptiste Lepilleur) explicitly disclaims copyright in all 
jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions, 
this software is released into the Public Domain.

In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of
2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste Lepilleur, and is
released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).

In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this 
software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the 
conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual 
Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
described in clear, concise terms at:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
   
The full text of the MIT License follows:

========================================================================
Copyright (c) 2007-2010 Baptiste Lepilleur

obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without

of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be

========================================================================
(END LICENSE TEXT)

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
license you like.
